# Core skills program - week 3 - Simple predictions, regression and statistical model building

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/core-skills/03-simple-predictions.git/master)

The aim of today's session will be to introduce simple regression as the basis for prediction, and discuss the factors that alter its accuracy and effectiveness. We'll move onto the basics of statistical modelling and examine some tools that let us emprically choose between the plethora of options and models availables to us.

You should aim to understand the basics of regression and how outliers, missing data and noise affect predictions. You'll should also understand the principle of Occam's Razor and how to choose between basic statistical models while evaluating their effectiveness. You should also aim to understand how hierarchical modelling can help you model more complex processes or datasets in a simple way.

## Pre-session Reading & Resources

**Todo:** add pre-session reading and resources (and _why_ you might like to read them - see [week two's README](https://github.com/core-skills/02-getting-to-know-the-tools/blob/master/README.md) as an example)
